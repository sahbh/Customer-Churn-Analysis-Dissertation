# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Dissertation
üìä Customer Churn Analysis in the Telecom Sector
As part of my MSc Big Data Science dissertation at Queen Mary University of London, I conducted an in-depth project focused on analysing customer churn in the telecommunications industry. This study aimed to uncover the financial and behavioural factors that lead to customer attrition, and to design effective retention strategies through data analysis and predictive modelling.

Using a real-world telecom dataset, I carried out the full data science pipeline:

Exploratory Data Analysis and advanced data visualisation to uncover key trends and outliers

Hypothesis testing (T-tests and logistic regression) to validate assumptions such as:

Longer subscriptions reduce churn

Higher monthly bills increase churn

Data pre-processing with SMOTE to handle class imbalance

Development and tuning of multiple machine learning models including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost (achieved 91% accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation)

üìå XGBoost outperformed all other models, delivering strong generalisation on unseen data and enabling clear interpretation through feature importance scores. Top features influencing churn included:

Contract type

Internet service quality

Number of referrals

Monthly charges and tenure

Key business recommendations included:

Incentivising long-term contracts

Improving fibre-optic service reliability

Targeting at-risk customers with tailored retention offers

Revamping ineffective promotions such as "Offer E"

üîç This project not only demonstrated technical expertise across data processing, statistics, and machine learning but also delivered real-world business insights to reduce churn and maximise customer lifetime value.
